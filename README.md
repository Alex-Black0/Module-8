1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves actively listening to stakeholders, analyzing their requirements, and translating those needs into actionable steps for development. User stories are an essential part of this process as they break down user requirements into small, manageable tasks written from the user’s perspective. For instance, during the SNHU Travel project, user stories like “As a traveler, I want to view the top destinations list so that I can plan my next vacation” helped ensure that the team focused on delivering features that directly benefited users. By aligning each user story with specific acceptance criteria, I was able to ensure clarity and prioritize tasks effectively.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is heavily influenced by Agile practices, which emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. Key processes I value include Sprint Planning, where the team defines the goals and tasks for each sprint, and Daily Standups, which ensure constant communication and alignment within the team. Another vital practice is Retrospectives, where the team reflects on their performance to identify areas for improvement. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate these Agile practices into my work to maintain a user-focused, adaptable, and collaborative development environment.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team’s goals while fostering an environment of trust and collaboration. It involves clear communication, supporting teammates when challenges arise, and being open to feedback. In the SNHU Travel project, I practiced these principles by ensuring transparent communication through Scrum events like sprint reviews and by collaborating with different roles such as the Product Owner and testers. A good team member also adapts to changes, values diverse perspectives, and prioritizes the success of the team over individual accomplishments.
